# First-Project
Create a web landing page using html, css, vanilla javascript, with consistent style across all plateforms.
I want to make this web site to display my favorit haiku poem from Basho.
This page have a gradient colored background, a frosty glass container and a 3d styled button with sound.
The favicons are included.
The display of the poem is in handwritten animated style using vava js library.
I ran into many problems, and as a first project I cannot go much further so I stopped for now.
Hopefully I will make some improvement after I learned React JS.
